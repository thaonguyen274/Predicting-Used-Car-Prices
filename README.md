# Predicting-Used-Car-Prices
This project is organized on the Kaggle competition, focusing on developing machine learning models that can accurately predict the price of a used car based on its features, in order to make informed purchases. - We implement and evaluate various learning methods on a dataset contains information about used cars listed on www.cardekho.com - Our results show that the Light GBM model is the best model with an accuracy of 98.1% on the test set. This result contributed to our third-place finish in the competition.
